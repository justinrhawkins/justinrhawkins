- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @justinrhawkins, I'm a Product Manager for CRF (crfusa.com).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Product Management and Process Improvement. I'm always looking for ways to help our team work more efficiently and effecitvely with the tools we have at hand.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ropes of formal Product Management after doing it informally for the last 5 years. Part of that journey has me learning more about SQL and some basic coding chops to help me with metrics collection and analysis.
